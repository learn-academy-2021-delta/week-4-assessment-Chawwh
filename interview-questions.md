# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are tools that allow us to transport a method or key value pair from a parent component to children components. props must be gifted through component calls.

  Researched answer: Props, short for properties, are arguments that we can pass to components. Through the use of props we can make functions and objects global!



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is when jaascript code updates an HTML element. An example I can think would be onClick; a function can be executed when the user clicks an element like a button!

  Researched answer: Dom events are when a user interacts with an html element that trigger a javascript execution. This can be anything from a mouse click to a reload.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP utilizes classes and methods while functional programming likes to use all functions

  Researched answer: Object oriented programming is all about creating objects and allowing them to communicate with eachother to achieve various tasks and functions.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: 
  <!-- Alrighty so lets start off knowing that both integers and floats are numbers. Now hear me out! I'm feeling a little fancy right now. Lets imagine that integers are solid bricks and floats are porous sponges. Now throw them both in the pool. THROW THEM. You'll notice that our little brick fellow sunk riiiight to the bottom. But don't worry! He knows how to swim. He sunk because he is whole. He is one with the land and water. Now the sponge? He's chilling on the surface, little wet but meh whatever. he's full of air. HOLES. BIG NASTY HOLES. IMCOMPLETE. RIDICULUS.  -->
  Integers are whole numbers while floats aren't. It's like the difference between something at the store being $5 versus $4.99. Whole number(integer) versus number with a decimal point(float).


  Researched answer: Both float and integers are numbers but Float refers to partial numbers like 3.9 or 21.7 while Integer refers to whole numbers only. With number like 4.0, even though it technically is a whole number, it is recognized as in integer because of the decimal point.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Ruby is so nice and friendly that it returns the value of the last line of a method automatically! #yay #MINASWAN 

  Researched answer: The term implicit return means ruby will automatically return the last line of the method unless you state otherwise.
